The aim of this plugin is to simplify the deployment and administration of cloud based web services, the magic of which chiefly consists of data synchronization and load balancing.

## synchronizer (cron @ cfg.ctswarm.interval)
 - fetch entities modded since last check
 - forward to cfg.ctswarm.peers
     - may be asymmetrical (e.g. for staging)
## revolver (drp-based load balancer!!!)
 - regular traffic is proxied as specified
 - media/big files are auto-302ed as necessary
